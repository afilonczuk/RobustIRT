\arguments{
\item{dat}{A \eqn{n \times m} matrix of dichotomously-coded data where 1 represents an endorsed response and 0 represents a non-endorsed response. \emph{n} is the test length and \emph{m} is the number of subjects.}

\item{a}{A \eqn{p\timesn} matrix containing fixed item slope parameters for \emph{n} items and \emph{p} dimensions}

\item{d}{A vector of length \emph{n} containing fixed intercept parameters for n items}

\item{iter}{Maximum number of iterations for the Newton-Rapshon method. Default is 100.}

\item{cutoff}{Threshold value to terminate the iteration when the likelihood changes below this value, which means that the estimation is converged. Default is 0.01.}

\item{tuning.par}{The tuning parameter for "bisquare" or "Huber" weighting functions. Greater tuning parameters result in less downweighting.}

\item{theta.initial}{A vector of length \emph{p} containing initial latent trait values for the maximum likelihood estimation. The default is 0 for each of the \emph{p} dimensions.}

\item{weight.category}{The weighting strategy to use: "equal", "bisquare", or "Huber". Default is "equal", which is equally weighted as in standard maximum likelihood estimation.}

\details{
The goal of robust estimation is to downweigh potentially aberrant responses to lessen their impact on the estimation of \eqn{\theta}. Robust estimates resist the harmful effects of response disturbances and tend to be less biased estimates of true ability than maximum likelihood estimates.
The contribution of item \emph{i} to the overall log-likelihood for one subject is weighted with a weight \eqn{\omega(r_i)} as a function of a residual \eqn{r_i} for the item \emph{i}:
\deqn{\sum_i^n \omega(r_i) \frac{\partial}{\partial\boldsymbol\theta} \ln L(\boldsymbol\theta;x_i) = 0 }
The residual, which measures the inconsistency of a response from the subject's assumed response model, is \deqn{r_i = \textbf a_i\boldsymbol\theta + d_i } in the multidimensional case.
Two types of weight functions are used: Tukey's bisquare weighting function (Mosteller & Tukey, 1977)
\deqn{\omega(r_i)=\begin{cases}[1-(r_i/B)^2]^2, & \text{if} |r_i|\leq B.\\0, & \text{if} |r_i|>B.\end{cases}}
and the Huber weighting function (Huber, 1981)
\deqn{\omega(r_i)=\begin{cases}1, & \text{if} |r_i|\leq H.\\H/|r_i|, & \text{if} |r_i|>H.\end{cases}}
Both functions are effective in estimating more accurate scores with aberrant data, although the bisquare weight function may lead to nonconvergence when using data containing a high proportion of incorrect responses (Schuster & Yuan, 2011).
